# What works
Probably everything. Not too sure about bluetooth (UI allows to turn it on, but can't use it for some reason).

# What's different from repo this is based on?
Mouse works even after waking up from sleep mode.
Wi-Fi works in native UI.

# Extras
For proper display scaling you can use this https://github.com/xzhih/one-key-hidpi (Highly recommended)

# Notes
Make sure to generate your own serial. Follow opencore guide for installation. I am not responsible for any screw-ups and I will not provide tech support.
